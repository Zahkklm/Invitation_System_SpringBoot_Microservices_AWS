# üöÄ Simple AWS ECS Deployment (No Copilot)

This is the **simplest way** to deploy your microservices to AWS without using Copilot or dealing with IAM role complexity.

## ‚ö° Quick Deploy

### Step 1: Push Docker Images to ECR
```powershell
.\deploy-ecs-simple.ps1
```

This script will:
- Create ECR repositories for all your microservices
- Build Docker images for all services
- Push images to AWS ECR
- Create ECS cluster

**Time:** ~10-15 minutes (depending on internet speed)

### Step 2: Deploy to ECS Fargate

After Step 1 completes, you have two options:

#### Option A: Use AWS Console (Easiest - Recommended)
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/
2. Click on `digitopia-cluster`
3. Click "Create Task Definition"
4. Follow the wizard to create task definitions for each service
5. Create services using the task definitions

**Why this is better:** Visual interface, easier to configure networking, load balancers, and environment variables.

#### Option B: Use AWS CLI (Advanced)
We can create task definitions and services using CLI scripts, but this requires:
- Creating JSON task definition files for each service
- Setting up VPC, subnets, security groups
- Configuring service discovery
- Setting up load balancers

## üí∞ Cost Estimate

### For Testing (1 hour):
- ECR storage: $0.01
- ECS Fargate (5 services): ~$0.40
- **Total: ~$0.41/hour**

### For Production (Always-On):
- ~$291/month (as calculated in COST_CALCULATOR.md)

## üéØ What You Get

After deployment:
- ‚úÖ All 5 microservices running in AWS ECS Fargate
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL databases for each service
- ‚úÖ Kafka for event streaming
- ‚úÖ Eureka server for service discovery
- ‚úÖ API Gateway for routing
- ‚úÖ Automatic scaling and health checks

## üîß Alternative: Deploy Locally First (FREE)

Test everything locally before deploying to AWS:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This gives you:
- ‚úÖ Identical functionality to AWS
- ‚úÖ $0.00 cost
- ‚úÖ Faster iteration
- ‚úÖ No AWS account issues

Test all endpoints locally, then deploy to AWS when ready.

## üìù Manual ECS Setup (Console)

If you want to set up ECS manually through the AWS Console:

### 1. Create VPC and Networking
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway (for private subnets)
- Security Groups (allow traffic between services)

### 2. Create Task Definitions
For each service, create a task definition with:
- Image URI: `<account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/digitopia/<service>:latest`
- CPU: 512 (.5 vCPU)
- Memory: 1024 MB (1 GB)
- Environment variables (database URLs, Kafka URLs, etc.)

### 3. Create ECS Services
For each task definition:
- Launch type: Fargate
- Desired count: 1
- VPC and subnets configuration
- Load balancer (for API Gateway and Eureka)
- Service discovery (optional)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Each service needs:
- Database connection strings
- Kafka broker URLs
- Eureka server URL
- AWS Cognito configuration

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Root Account Warning**: If you're using AWS root account, you'll have issues with some AWS services. Create an IAM user with AdministratorAccess instead.

2. **Cost Monitoring**: Set up billing alerts in AWS Console to avoid unexpected charges.

3. **Testing First**: Always test locally with `docker-compose up` before deploying to AWS.

4. **Database Persistence**: Use RDS for PostgreSQL in production instead of Docker containers for better reliability and backups.

## üìö Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Set up monitoring**: Use CloudWatch for logs and metrics
2. **Configure auto-scaling**: Set up CPU/memory-based scaling
3. **Add load balancers**: Use ALB for API Gateway
4. **Set up CI/CD**: Automate deployments with GitHub Actions
5. **Configure backups**: RDS automated backups for databases

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Docker build fails
```powershell
# Check if Docker Desktop is running
docker ps
```

### AWS CLI errors
```powershell
# Verify credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### ECR push fails
```powershell
# Re-login to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
